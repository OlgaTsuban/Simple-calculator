# Simple Calculator 

This is a basic calculator program built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It can perform simple arithmetic calculations and includes some additional mathematical functions.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers.
- Calculation of square roots.
- Calculation of squares (xÂ²).
- Calculation of trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, and cot.
- Clearing the calculation field.
- Deleting the last character from the calculation field.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Usage

1. Run the program by executing `python main.py` in your terminal (or python3 main.py - for MacOS).

2. The calculator window will open, displaying a text field for input and buttons for numeric digits, basic operators, and additional functions.

3. Click on the numeric buttons to enter numbers. Click on operator buttons to perform operations, and click on additional function buttons to perform advanced calculations.

4. Press the `=` button to calculate the result, `CLEAR` to clear the input field, and `DEL` to delete the last character.

## How It Works

The program uses a simple GUI created with Tkinter to accept user input and display the results. It includes a decorator (`input_error`) to handle errors in input calculations gracefully.

## Example

Here's how to use the calculator:

1. Enter an arithmetic expression like `2 + 3 * 4`.

2. Press `=` to calculate the result, which will appear in the text field.

3. Use additional functions like square root, trigonometric functions, etc., as needed.
